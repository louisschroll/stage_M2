	abstract = {Occupancy modelling is a common approach to assess species distribution patterns, while explicitly accounting for false absences in detection–nondetection data. Numerous extensions of the basic single-species occupancy model exist to model multiple species, spatial autocorrelation and to integrate multiple data types. However, development of specialized and computationally efficient software to incorporate such extensions, especially for large datasets, is scarce or absent. We introduce the {spOccupancy} R package designed to fit single-species and multi-species spatially explicit occupancy models. We fit all models within a Bayesian framework using Pólya-Gamma data augmentation, which results in fast and efficient inference. {spOccupancy} provides functionality for data integration of multiple single-species detection–nondetection datasets via a joint likelihood framework. The package leverages Nearest Neighbour Gaussian Processes to account for spatial autocorrelation, which enables spatially explicit occupancy modelling for potentially massive datasets (e.g. 1,000s–100,000s of sites). {spOccupancy} provides user-friendly functions for data simulation, model fitting, model validation (by posterior predictive checks), model comparison (using information criteria and k-fold cross-validation) and out-of-sample prediction. We illustrate the package's functionality via a vignette, simulated data analysis and two bird case studies. The {spOccupancy} package provides a user-friendly platform to fit a variety of single and multi-species occupancy models, making it straightforward to address detection biases and spatial autocorrelation in species distribution models even for large datasets.},

This has spurred the development of data integration methods that simultaneously harness information from multiple datasets while dealing with the specific strengths and weaknesses of each dataset. We outline the general principles that have guided data integration methods and review recent developments in the field. We then outline key areas that allow for a more general framework for integrating data and provide suggestions for improving sampling design and validation for integrated models. Key to recent advances has been using point-process thinking to combine estimators developed for different data types. Extending this framework to new data types will further improve our inferences, as well as relaxing assumptions about how parameters are jointly estimated. These along with the better use of information regarding sampling effort and spatial autocorrelation will further improve our inferences. Recent developments form a strong foundation for implementation of data integration models. Wider adoption can improve our inferences about species distributions and the dynamic processes that lead to distributional shifts.},

Advantages include (and are not limited to) clarification of what the response variable is that is modelled; a framework for choosing the number and location of quadrature points (commonly referred to as pseudo-absences or ‘background points’) objectively; clarity of model assumptions and tools for checking them; models to handle spatial dependence between points when it is present; and ways forward regarding difficult issues such as accounting for sampling bias.

	abstract = {Understanding and accurately modeling species distributions lies at the heart of many problems in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Multiple sources of data are increasingly available for modeling species distributions, such as data from citizen science programs, atlases, museums, and planned surveys. Yet reliably combining data sources can be challenging because data sources can vary considerably in their design, gradients covered, and potential sampling biases. We review, synthesize, and illustrate recent developments in combining multiple sources of data for species distribution modeling. We identify five ways in which multiple sources of data are typically combined for modeling species distributions. These approaches vary in their ability to accommodate sampling design, bias, and uncertainty when quantifying environmental relationships in species distribution models. Many of the challenges for combining data are solved through the prudent use of integrated species distribution models: models that simultaneously combine different data sources on species locations to quantify environmental relationships for explaining species distribution. We illustrate these approaches using planned survey data on 24 species of birds coupled with opportunistically collected {eBird} data in the southeastern United States. This example illustrates some of the benefits of data integration, such as increased precision in environmental relationships, greater predictive accuracy, and accounting for sample bias. Yet it also illustrates challenges of combining data sources with vastly different sampling methodologies and amounts of data. We provide one solution to this challenge through the use of weighted joint likelihoods. Weighted joint likelihoods provide a means to emphasize data sources based on different criteria (e.g., sample size), and we find that weighting improves predictions for all species considered. We conclude by providing practical guidance on combining multiple sources of data for modeling species distributions.},

Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between {SDM} practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress.

However, users often underestimate the strong links between data type, model output and suitability for end-use. We synthesize current knowledge and provide a simple framework that summarizes how interactions between data type and the sampling process (i.e. imperfect detection and sampling bias) determine the quantity that is estimated by a {SDM}. We then draw upon the published literature and simulations to illustrate and evaluate the information needs of the most common ecological, biogeographical and conservation applications of {SDM} outputs. We find that, while predictions of models fitted to the most commonly available observational data (presence records) suffice for some applications, others require estimates of occurrence probabilities, which are unattainable without reliable absence records. Our literature review and simulations reveal that, while converting continuous {SDM} outputs into categories of assumed presence or absence is common practice, it is seldom clearly justified by the application's objective and it usually degrades inference. Matching {SDMs} to the needs of particular applications is critical to avoid poor scientific inference and management outcomes. This paper aims to help modellers and users assess whether their intended {SDM} outputs are indeed fit for purpose.},

	abstract = {There is increasing need for methods that integrate multiple data types into a single analytical framework as the spatial and temporal scale of ecological research expands. Current work on this topic primarily focuses on combining capture–recapture data from marked individuals with other data types into integrated population models. Yet, studies of species distributions and trends often rely on data from unmarked individuals across broad scales where local abundance and environmental variables may vary. We present a modeling framework for integrating detection–nondetection and count data into a single analysis to estimate population dynamics, abundance, and individual detection probabilities during sampling. Our dynamic population model assumes that site-specific abundance can change over time according to survival of individuals and gains through reproduction and immigration. The observation process for each data type is modeled by assuming that every individual present at a site has an equal probability of being detected during sampling processes. We examine our modeling approach through a series of simulations illustrating the relative value of count vs. detection–nondetection data under a variety of parameter values and survey configurations. We also provide an empirical example of the model by combining long-term detection–nondetection data (1995–2014) with newly collected count data (2015–2016) from a growing population of Barred Owl (Strix varia) in the Pacific Northwest to examine the factors influencing population abundance over time. Our model provides a foundation for incorporating unmarked data within a single framework, even in cases where sampling processes yield different detection probabilities. This approach will be useful for survey design and to researchers interested in incorporating historical or citizen science data into analyses focused on understanding how demographic rates drive population abundance.},

We embed the {NNGP} as a sparsity-inducing prior within a rich hierarchical modeling framework and outline how computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithms can be executed without storing or decomposing large matrices. The floating point operations (flops) per iteration of this algorithm is linear in the number of spatial locations, thereby rendering substantial scalability. We illustrate the computational and inferential benefits of the {NNGP} over competing methods using simulation studies and also analyze forest biomass from a massive U.S. Forest Inventory dataset at a scale that precludes alternative dimension-reducing methods.

	abstract = {The past decade has seen an explosion in the development and application of models aimed at estimating species occurrence and occupancy dynamics while accounting for possible non-detection or species misidentification. We discuss some recent occupancy estimation methods and the biological systems that motivated their development. Collectively, these models offer tremendous flexibility, but simultaneously place added demands on the investigator. Unlike many mark–recapture scenarios, investigators utilizing occupancy models have the ability, and responsibility, to define their sample units (i.e. sites), replicate sampling occasions, time period over which species occurrence is assumed to be static and even the criteria that constitute ‘detection’ of a target species. Subsequent biological inference and interpretation of model parameters depend on these definitions and the ability to meet model assumptions. We demonstrate the relevance of these definitions by highlighting applications from a single biological system (an amphibian–pathogen system) and discuss situations where the use of occupancy models has been criticized. Finally, we use these applications to suggest future research and model development.},

	abstract = {We show that occupancy models are more difficult to fit than is generally appreciated because the estimating equations often have multiple solutions, including boundary estimates which produce fitted probabilities of zero or one. The estimates are unstable when the data are sparse, making them difficult to interpret, and, even in ideal situations, highly variable. As a consequence, making accurate inference is difficult. When abundance varies over sites (which is the general rule in ecology because we expect spatial variance in abundance) and detection depends on abundance, the standard analysis suffers bias (attenuation in detection, biased estimates of occupancy and potentially finding misleading relationships between occupancy and other covariates), asymmetric sampling distributions, and slow convergence of the sampling distributions to normality. The key result of this paper is that the biases are of similar magnitude to those obtained when we ignore non-detection entirely. The fact that abundance is subject to detection error and hence is not directly observable, means that we cannot tell when bias is present (or, equivalently, how large it is) and we cannot adjust for it. This implies that we cannot tell which fit is better: the fit from the occupancy model or the fit ignoring the possibility of detection error. Therefore trying to adjust occupancy models for non-detection can be as misleading as ignoring non-detection completely. Ignoring non-detection can actually be better than trying to adjust for it.},

The most fundamental assumption underlying these models is that “false positive” errors are not possible. That is, one cannot detect a species where it does not occur. However, such errors are possible in many sampling situations for a number of reasons, and even low false positive error rates can induce extreme bias in estimates of site occupancy when they are not accounted for. In this paper, we develop a model for site occupancy that allows for both false negative and false positive error rates. This model can be represented as a two-component finite mixture model and can be easily fitted using freely available software. We provide an analysis of avian survey data using the proposed model and present results of a brief simulation study evaluating the performance of the maximum-likelihood estimator and the naive estimator in the presence of false positive errors.},

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

Furthermore, the decision framework within which {SDMs} are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that {SDMs} may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate {SDMs} to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of {SDMs} to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of ‘translators’ between modellers and decision makers. We encourage species distribution modellers to get involved in real decision-making processes that will benefit from their technical input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory and practice, and contribute to improve both scientific knowledge and conservation outcomes.},

However, in teaching Bayesian methods and in working with our research colleagues, we have noticed a general dissatisfaction with the available literature on Bayesian model selection and multimodel inference. Students and researchers new to Bayesian methods quickly find that the published advice on model selection is often preferential in its treatment of options for analysis, frequently advocating one particular method above others. The recent appearance of many articles and textbooks on Bayesian modeling has provided welcome background on relevant approaches to model selection in the Bayesian framework, but most of these are either very narrowly focused in scope or inaccessible to ecologists. Moreover, the methodological details of Bayesian model selection approaches are spread thinly throughout the literature, appearing in journals from many different fields. Our aim with this guide is to condense the large body of literature on Bayesian approaches to model selection and multimodel inference and present it specifically for quantitative ecologists as neutrally as possible. We also bring to light a few important and fundamental concepts relating directly to model selection that seem to have gone unnoticed in the ecological literature. Throughout, we provide only a minimal discussion of philosophy, preferring instead to examine the breadth of approaches as well as their practical advantages and disadvantages. This guide serves as a reference for ecologists using Bayesian methods, so that they can better understand their options and can make an informed choice that is best aligned with their goals for inference.},

The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, {GFs} are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with {GFs}, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields ({GMRFs}) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a {GMRF} is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some {GFs} in the Matérn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of , between {GFs} and {GMRFs}, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using {GFs} but do the computations by using {GMRFs}. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by {SPDEs}, including oscillating and non-stationary {GFs}, as well as {GFs} on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

	abstract = {Checking that models adequately represent data is an essential component of applied statistical inference. Ecologists increasingly use hierarchical Bayesian statistical models in their research. The appeal of this modeling paradigm is undeniable, as researchers can build and fit models that embody complex ecological processes while simultaneously accounting for observation error. However, ecologists tend to be less focused on checking model assumptions and assessing potential lack of fit when applying Bayesian methods than when applying more traditional modes of inference such as maximum likelihood. There are also multiple ways of assessing the fit of Bayesian models, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Bayesian P values are relatively easy to compute, but are well known to be conservative, producing P values biased toward 0.5. Alternatively, lesser known approaches to model checking, such as prior predictive checks, cross-validation probability integral transforms, and pivot discrepancy measures may produce more accurate characterizations of goodness-of-fit but are not as well known to ecologists. In addition, a suite of visual and targeted diagnostics can be used to examine violations of different model assumptions and lack of fit at different levels of the modeling hierarchy, and to check for residual temporal or spatial autocorrelation. In this review, we synthesize existing literature to guide ecologists through the many available options for Bayesian model checking. We illustrate methods and procedures with several ecological case studies including (1) analysis of simulated spatiotemporal count data, (2) N-mixture models for estimating abundance of sea otters from an aircraft, and (3) hidden Markov modeling to describe attendance patterns of California sea lion mothers on a rookery. We find that commonly used procedures based on posterior predictive P values detect extreme model inadequacy, but often do not detect more subtle cases of lack of fit. Tests based on cross-validation and pivot discrepancy measures (including the “sampled predictive P value”) appear to be better suited to model checking and to have better overall statistical performance. We conclude that model checking is necessary to ensure that scientific inference is well founded. As an essential component of scientific discovery, it should accompany most Bayesian analyses presented in the literature.},

Spatial variability of seabird distribution associated with environmental factors: a case study of marine Important Bird Areas in the Azores. – {ICES} Journal of Marine Science, 66: 29–40.The spatial structure and distribution at sea of Cory's shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea borealis), common terns (Sterna hirundo), and roseate terns (Sterna dougallii) were analysed in the Azores for various environmental factors: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, distance to fronts, wind, distance to island shore or tern colonies, distance to seamounts, seabed slope, and depth. Data on seabird sightings were collected by observers on board fishing vessels, 2002–2006. Generalized linear modelling ({GLM}) explained 43 and 11\% of the abundance variability for terns (both species pooled) and Cory's shearwaters, respectively. Variability in seabird abundance was mainly explained by month, wind, distance to shore and/or tern colonies, and distance to seamounts. Variogram modelling indicated that species distribution presented a small-scale spatial structure (i.e. low autocorrelation). Cory's shearwater predictive distribution maps showed widespread distribution patterns of abundance, despite occurring at a greater intensity around the islands and around some seamounts, which are areas of fishery interest. Conversely, terns were essentially concentrated near the shore. The establishment of marine important bird areas should be encouraged close to seabird colonies and around some seamount areas.},

	abstract = {Seabirds are known to concentrate on prey patches or at predators aggregations standing for potential feeding opportunities. They may search for prey using olfaction or by detecting visually feeding con-specifics and sub-surface predators, or even boats. Thus, they might form a foraging network. We hypothesized that conditionally to the existence of a foraging network, the visual detection ability of seabirds should have a bearing on their medium-scale distribution at sea. Using a fishing-boat radar to catch the instantaneous distribution of seabirds groups within 30 km around the vessel, we conducted a spatial clustering of the seabird-echoes. We found 7,657 clusters (i.e. aggregations of echoes), lasting less than 15 minutes and measuring 9.2 km in maximum length (median). Distances between seabirds groups within clusters showed little variation (median: 2.1 km; {CV}: 0.5), while area varied largely (median: 21.9 km2; {CV}: 0.8). Given existing data on seabirds’ reaction distances to boats or other marine predators, we suggest that these structures may represent active foraging sequences of seabirds spreading themselves in space such as to possibly cue on each others. These seabird clusters were not previously described and are size compatible with the existence of a foraging network.},

	abstract = {Biological production in the oceanic zone (i.e. waters beyond the continental shelves) is typically spatially patchy and strongly seasonal. In response, seabirds have adapted to move rapidly within and between ocean basins, making them important pelagic consumers. Studies in the Pacific, Southern and Indian Oceans have shown that seabirds are relatively abundant in major frontal systems, with species composition varying by water mass. In contrast, surprisingly little was known about seabird distribution in the oceanic North Atlantic until recent tracking showed that relative abundance and diversity peak in the Sub-polar Frontal Zone, west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, now proposed as a Marine Protected Area. However, absolute seabird abundance, distribution, age and species composition, and their potential environmental drivers in the oceanic temperate {NW} Atlantic remain largely unknown. Consequently, we systematically surveyed seabirds and environmental conditions across this area by ship in June 2017, then modelled the density of common species as functions of environmental covariates, validating model predictions against independent tracking data. Medium-sized petrels (99.8\%), especially Great Shearwaters (Ardenna gravis, 63\%), accounted for the majority of total avian biomass, which correlated at the macroscale with net primary production and peaked at the sub-polar front. At the mesoscale, the density of each species was associated with sea surface temperature, indicating zonation by water mass. Most species also exhibited scale-dependent associations with eddies and fronts. Approximately 51, 26, 23, 7 and 1 \% of the currently estimated Atlantic populations of Cory's Shearwaters (Calonectris borealis), Great Shearwaters, Sooty Shearwaters (A. grisea), Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) and Leach’s Storm-petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) occurred in the area during our survey, many of which were undergoing moult (a vital maintena nce activity). For some species, these estimates are higher than suggested by tracking, probably due to the presence of immatures and birds from untracked populations. Our results support the conclusion that {MPA} status is warranted and provide a baseline against which future changes can be assessed. Moreover, they indicate potential drivers of seabird abundance and diversity in the oceanic zone of the North Atlantic that should be investigated further.},

	abstract = {Tracking data of marine predators are increasingly used in marine spatial management. We developed a spatial data set with estimates of the monthly distribution of 6 pelagic seabird species breeding in the Northeast Atlantic. The data set was based on year-round global location sensor ({GLS}) tracking data of 2356 adult seabirds from 2006-2019 from a network of seabird colonies, data describing the physical environment and data on seabird population sizes. Tracking and environmental data were combined in monthly species distribution models ({SDMs}). Cross-validations were used to assess the transferability of models between years and breeding locations. The analyses showed that birds from colonies close to each other ({\textless}500 km apart) used the same nonbreeding habitats, while birds from distant colonies ({\textgreater}1000 km) used colony-specific and, in many cases, non-overlapping habitats. Based on these results, the {SDM} from the nearest model colony was used to predict the distribution of all seabird colonies lying within a species-specific cut-off distance (400-500 km). Uncertainties in the predictions were estimated by cluster bootstrap sampling. The resulting data set consisted of 4692 map layers, each layer predicting the densities of birds from a given species, colony and month across the North Atlantic. This data set represents the annual distribution of 23.5 million adult pelagic seabirds, or 87\% of the Northeast Atlantic breeding population of the study species. We show how the data set can be used in population and spatial management applications, including the detection of population-specific nonbreeding habitats and identifying populations influenced by marine protected areas.},

To investigate the seasonal variability in seabird distribution and abundance in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea ({NWMS}), we conducted two large-scale aerial surveys in winter 2011–12 and summer 2012, covering a 181,400km2 area. Following a strip-transect method, observers recorded a total of 4141 seabird sightings in winter and 2334 in summer, along 32,213km. Using geostatistical methods, we generated sightings density maps for both seasons, as well as estimates of density and abundance. Most taxa showed seasonal variations in their density and distribution patterns, as they used the area either for wintering or for breeding. Highest densities of seabirds were recorded during winter, although large-sized shearwaters, storm petrels and terns were more abundant during summer. Consequently, with nearly 170,000 seabirds estimated in winter, the total abundance was twice higher in winter. Coastal waters of the continental shelf were generally more exploited by seabirds, even though some species, such as Mediterranean gulls, black-headed gulls, little gulls and storm petrels were found at high densities in highly offshore waters. Our results revealed areas highly exploited by the seabird community in the {NWMS}, such as the Gulf of Lion, the Tuscan region, and the area between Corsica and Sardinia. In addition, these large-scale surveys provide a baseline for the monitoring of seabird at sea distribution, and could inform the {EU} Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

During marine conservation planning, logistical constraints preclude seabird surveys covering the complete area of interest and spatial distribution of seabirds is frequently inferred from predictive statistical models. Increasingly complex models are available to relate the distribution and abundance of pelagic seabirds to environmental variables, but a comparison of their usefulness for delineating protected areas for seabirds is lacking. Here we compare the performance of five modelling techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, Random Forest, boosted regression trees, and maximum entropy) to predict the distribution of Balearic Shearwaters (Puffinus mauretanicus) along the coast of the western Iberian Peninsula. We used ship transect data from 2004 to 2009 and 13 environmental variables to predict occurrence and density, and evaluated predictive performance of all models using spatially segregated test data. Predicted distribution varied among the different models, although predictive performance varied little. An ensemble prediction that combined results from all five techniques was robust and confirmed the existence of marine important bird areas for Balearic Shearwaters in Portugal and Spain. Our predictions suggested additional areas that would be of high priority for conservation and could be proposed as protected areas. Abundance data were extremely difficult to predict, and none of five modelling techniques provided a reliable prediction of spatial patterns. We advocate the use of ensemble modelling that combines the output of several methods to predict the spatial distribution of seabirds, and use these predictions to target separate surveys assessing the abundance of seabirds in areas of regular use.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimates of population abundance are essential to both theoretical and applied ecology. Rarely are all individuals detected during a survey and abundance models often incorporate some form of imperfect detection. Detection probability, however, consists of three components: probability of presence during a survey, probability of availability given presence, and probability of detection given availability and presence. We develop an integrated model to separate these three detection components and provide abundance estimates for the available, present, and superpopulation of individuals. Our framework integrates several common survey methods for unmarked populations: spatially and temporally replicated counts, distance sampling data, and time-of-detection data. Simulations indicated relatively unbiased estimates for detection and availability probabilities. Negative bias in estimated superpopulation abundance was present with three temporally replicated surveys, but greatly reduced with six surveys. In a case study of Island Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma insularis), posterior modes for presence, availability, and detection probabilities were 0.78, 0.96, and 0.26, respectively, from 10-min point counts repeated at 97 sites on three occasions, with noticeable differences among available, present, and superpopulation abundance estimates. This generalizable framework integrates common sampling protocols and provides joint inferences on the components of detection probability, spatial and non-spatial temporary emigration, and abundance in unmarked populations.},

To meet this aim, data collected via multiple platforms, across different geographical and temporal regions, may need to be integrated, yet many ecologists remain unclear about the relationships between data types and therefore how they can be combined. In seabird research, these applied questions can be particularly pressing because many human activities (e.g. tidal and wind renewables, fishing, shipping, etc.) are concentrated in coastal waters, where many seabirds also aggregate, especially while breeding. In addition, seabird coloniality and density dependence present unique analytical challenges. We review the relevant literature on data integration and illustrate it with example models and data (in an accompanying R-library and supplementary vignette ), to derive methodological and quantitative guidelines for best practice in conducting joint inference for multi-platform data. We use systematic survey data to motivate the key arguments, but also overview developments in integration with other data (e.g. telemetry tracking, citizen science, mark–recapture). We make recommendations on (a) the use of response and explanatory data, (b) the treatment of survey design and observation errors, (c) exploiting dependencies across space and time, (d) accounting for biological phenomena, such as commuting costs from the colony (i.e. accessibility) and density dependence, and (e) the choice of statistical framework. Synthesis and application. Integrated analysis of multi-platform data turns many of the seabird-specific challenges into opportunities for inferring habitat associations and predicting future distributions. Our review proposes practical recommendations for data collection and analysis that will allow seabird conservation to derive maximal benefits from these opportunities.},

This article presents a method where a simple Pearson chi-square statistic is calculated and a parametric bootstrap procedure is used to determine whether the observed statistic is unusually large. We found evidence that the most global model considered provides a poor fit to the data, hence estimated an overdispersion factor to adjust model selection procedures and inflate standard errors. Two hypothetical datasets with known assumption violations are also analyzed, illustrating that the method may be used to guide researchers to making appropriate inferences.

Even in the simplest of experiments, investigators must think critically and prospectively about the degree of community protection they wish to provide as they determine the type I and type {II} errors. As I pointed out in chapters 7 and 8, the application of p values to experiments in health care is even more complicated when these experiments have more than two treatment arms and multiple endpoints. In all cases, the experiment must be executed concordantly, according to the protocol, so that the resulting p values are interpretable. These endeavors are not to be undertaken lightly.},

The probability of attack increased significantly with fish size and declined significantly as the season progressed. Most attacks were on terns as they landed to deliver their prey.

Yellow-legged gull and Cory's shearwater were the most common species in the study area (52.35\%, 35.49\%) and behind boats (82.4\%, 7.07\%). Eight other seabird species were observed in much lower numbers following boats (Audouin's gull 2.6\%, black-headed gull 2.3\%, sandwich 1.5\%, black 0.82\% and common terns 0.97\%, Balearic shearwaters 1.4\%, storm-petrel 0.52\% and shags 0.36\%). Yellow-legged gulls were present behind trawlers in higher numbers than might have been expected by its abundance at sea, whereas Cory's shearwaters were less so. The discarded fish (“discard”) comprised mainly of sardine (22.4\%), flatfish (19.1\%) and horse-mackerel (17.3\%) and included fish of a small size (median 10.5 cm) in the main. Yellow-legged gull made the largest use of discards, albeit lower than expected by its Presence Index. Average percentage consumption was about 54\% of the edible discards, suggesting that yellow-legged gulls were not highly efficient at catching “discard”. The average ratio of fish discarded over fish landed was ca. 65\%, although the range was very variable (23–175\%). Estimates of the energy requirements of yellow-legged gulls and “energy availability” from the ca. 8 tonnes of discard produced every fishing day, suggest that trawling waste was probably enough to support a local gull population four times larger than that present during the study period.

Here, we analysed Yelkouan Shearwater diet, as well as metal (lead, cadmium, mercury, selenium) and organic contamination. The diet analysis revealed the predominance of fish prey, particularly Clupeids, Engraulids and Scombrids, both in terms of relative occurrence (84.6\%) and relative biomass (99.7\%). Crustaceans (Euphasiacea and Decapoda) were the major prey type during the pre-laying period (relative number: 88.8\%) but contributed little to the biomass ingested. The metal levels we found in contour feathers were below the known adverse effect threshold for seabirds.

New light-weight {GPS} (Global Positioning System) loggers ({\textless} 9 g) were used to track foraging trips of a medium-sized species, the Cory's shearwater, for the first time in the Mediterranean Sea. The tracks obtained showed that Mediterranean Cory's shearwaters alternatively used one of two different fishing areas. Various explanations could account for this difference; one of these could be that the two directions have a different relevance for the birds, being for chick- and self-provisioning. This study provides new hypotheses concerning the behaviour of Cory's shearwaters in the Mediterranean Sea, a different environment compared to previously studied oceans.},

Despite this lack of data and the susceptibility of closely related species to threats at breeding sites and foraging areas, the yelkouan shearwater is currently considered to be at low risk of extinction. This review, based on published documents, personal communications with scientists and our own observations, summarizes available data on range, population size and trends, and on threats to the species' existence. Breeding sites range from the Marseille islands (France) to Bulgarian islands in the Black Sea but many are not confirmed. The estimated global population is 11,355-54,524 pairs but most censuses are probably overestimates and the global population could be only a few thousand breeding pairs. There is evidence of a population decline and susceptibility to introduced mammals, particularly feral cats Felis catus and ship rats Rattus rattus, and to accidental bycatch in fishing gear. We highlight the lack of accurate and regular censuses of the species, and the alarming situation suggested by the little data available. We recommend that the yelkouan shearwater be categorized as Near Threatened on the {IUCN} Red List, encourage collaborative work to clarify its status, and make a plea for more data on the species’ demography and ecology, and for the evaluation of terrestrial and marine threats.},

We show that false-negative errors (failure to record a species when in fact it is present) can have a significant impact on statistical estimation of habitat models using simulated data. Then we introduce an extension of logistic modeling, the zero-inflated binomial ({ZIB}) model that permits the estimation of the rate of false-negative errors and the correction of estimates of the probability of occurrence for false-negative errors by using repeated visits to the same site. Our simulations show that even relatively low rates of false negatives bias statistical estimates of habitat effects. The method with three repeated visits eliminates the bias, but estimates are relatively imprecise. Six repeated visits improve precision of estimates to levels comparable to that achieved with conventional statistics in the absence of false-negative errors. In general, when error rates are ≤50\% greater efficiency is gained by adding more sites, whereas when error rates are {\textgreater}50\% it is better to increase the number of repeated visits. We highlight the flexibility of the method with three case studies, clearly demonstrating the effect of false-negative errors for a range of commonly used survey methods.},

	abstract = {In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2λ/n, where λ is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.},

Habitat-selection analyses that incorporate movement characteristics, referred to as integrated step-selection analyses, are particularly appealing because they allow modelling of both movement and habitat-selection processes. Despite their popularity, many users struggle with interpreting parameters in habitat-selection and step-selection functions. Integrated step-selection analyses also require several additional steps to translate model parameters into a full-fledged movement model, and the mathematics supporting this approach can be challenging for many to understand. Using simple examples, we demonstrate how weighted distribution theory and the inhomogeneous Poisson point process can facilitate parameter interpretation in habitat-selection analyses. Furthermore, we provide a ‘how to’ guide illustrating the steps required to implement integrated step-selection analyses using the amt package By providing clear examples with open-source code, we hope to make habitat-selection analyses more understandable and accessible to end users.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Offshore wind energy development ({OWED}) has been identified as a major contributor to the aspired growth in Norwegian renewable energy production. Spatially explicit vulnerability assessments are necessary to select sites that minimize the harm to biodiversity, including seabird populations. Distributional data of seabirds in remote areas are scarce, and to identify vulnerable areas, species, and seasons it is necessary to combine data sets and knowledge from different sources.Methods: In this study, we combined seabird tracking data, data from dedicated coastal and seabird at-sea surveys, and presence-only data from citizen science databases to develop habitat suitability maps for 55 seabird species in four seasons throughout the Norwegian exclusive economic zone; in total 1 million km 2 in the Northeast Atlantic. The habitat suitability maps were combined with species-specific vulnerability indicators to yield maps of seabird vulnerability to offshore wind farms ({OWFs}). The resulting map product can be used to identify the relative vulnerability of areas prospected for {OWED} with respect to seabird collision and habitat displacement. More detailed assessments can be done by splitting the spatial indicators into seasonal and species-specific components.Results and Discussion: Associated with higher diversity of seabirds near the coast, the cumulative vulnerability indicator showed a strong declining gradient from the coast to offshore waters while the differences in vulnerability between ocean areas and seasons were negligible. Although the present map product represents the best currently available knowledge, the indicators are associated with complex uncertainties related to known and unknown sampling biases. The indicators should therefore be used cautiously, they should be updated regularly as more data become available, and we recommend that more detailed environmental impact assessments based on dedicated seabird surveys, tracking of birds from potentially affected populations and population viability analyses are conducted in areas ultimately selected for {OWED}.},

	abstract = {Contrasting to the overall oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea, the north-western basin is characterised by high productivity and marked by seasonality, which induces spatiotemporal heterogeneity of habitat. Cetaceans and seabirds are expected to perceive this repetition of the seasonal cycle and to anticipate the recurrent variability of their environment. Because phenology imposes strong constraints over marine predators, especially through reproduction, we expected them to exhibit variations in their habitat preferences over seasons. Indeed, during reproductive period, marine predators have to face their own needs and those of their young, while out of this period, they can focus on maximising their own survival only. We therefore hypothesised that some species would change their habitat preferences to exploit the most favourable habitat during each season, while other species might accommodate the same habitat all year-round, for example thanks to the use of an habitat favourable all the year. To explore these hypotheses, we used aerial surveys data conducted over north-western Mediterranean Sea during winter 2011–2012 and summer 2012. Generalised Additive Models were used to link the species density to a set of 12 physiographic and oceanographic predictors describing their environment. Habitat models resulted in deviances from 12 to 47\%. Our results provided the ﬁrst assessment of habitat preferences for the winter season for most of our studied species. Small-sized delphinids (mostly stripped dolphins), ﬁn whales, Globicephalinae (long-ﬁnned pilot whales and Risso's dolphins) and small-sized shearwaters (Yelkouan and Balearic shearwaters) exhibited no habitat variations between seasons, although for the ﬁrst two, abundances were lower in winter. On the contrary, bottlenose dolphins switched from coastal habitat in summer to pelagic habitat in winter, while Cory's shearwaters and storm petrels exhibited the largest habitat variations between seasons with a complete absence during winter.},

The inefficiency of thinning {MCMC} output has been known since the early 1990’s, long before {MCMC} appeared in ecological publications. 4. We discuss the background and prevalence of thinning, illustrate its consequences, discuss circumstances when it might be regarded as a reasonable option and recommend against routine thinning of chains unless necessitated by computer memory limitations.},

	abstract = {N-mixture models were born in 2004 of the necessity to model animal population size from point counts with imperfect detection of individuals, where capture-recapture methods are infeasible. Initially developed for applications where population size was assumed constant, N-mixture models were extended in 2011 to include population dynamics, allowing application to populations whose size fluctuates during the study. A further extension in 2014 accommodates populations with multiple “states” such as age class or sex. More recent extensions model spatial movement of animals among habitat patches or the spatial spread of infectious disease in a human population. The core idea underlying this class of models is a hierarchical structure, where the observation model is defined conditional on the model for true abundance. This hierarchy allows researchers to incorporate information about observation and abundance processes, while permitting distinct inferences about elements affecting detection and those affecting abundance. Another benefit of the hierarchical approach is the ability to accommodate many existing sampling protocols such as removal sampling and distance sampling. One drawback to N-mixture models is that since they estimate both abundance and detection from replicated but unmarked counts, model parameters may not be clearly identifiable. A second drawback is that when observed counts are large, calculating the N-mixture likelihood is computationally infeasible. This difficulty motivated an approximate likelihood based on the normal approximation to the binomial. The normal approximation provides a diagnostic of parameter estimability based on the closed-form expression of the Fisher information matrix for a multivariate normal likelihood.

	abstract = {Using geospatial data of wildlife presence to predict a species distribution across a geographic area is among the most common tools in management and conservation. The collection of high-quality presence–absence ({PA}) data through structured surveys is, however, expensive, and managers usually have access to larger amounts of low-quality presence-only ({PO}) data collected by citizen scientists, opportunistic observations and culling returns for game species. Integrated species distribution models ({ISDMs}) have been developed to make the most of the data available by combining the higher-quality, but usually scarcer and more spatially restricted, {PA} data with the lower-quality, unstructured, but usually more extensive {PO} datasets. Joint-likelihood {ISDMs} can be run in a Bayesian context using integrated nested laplace approximation methods that allow the addition of a spatially structured random effect to account for data spatial autocorrelation. Here, we apply this innovative approach to fit {ISDMs} to empirical data, using {PA} and {PO} data for the three prevalent deer species in Ireland: red, fallow and sika deer. We collated all deer data available for the past 15 years and fitted models predicting distribution and relative abundance at a 25 km2 resolution across the island. Model predictions were associated to spatial estimate of uncertainty, allowing us to assess the quality of the model and the effect that data scarcity has on the certainty of predictions. Furthermore, we checked the performance of the three species-specific models using two datasets, independent deer hunting returns and deer densities based on faecal pellet counts. Our work clearly demonstrates the applicability of spatially explicit {ISDMs} to empirical data in a Bayesian context, providing a blueprint for managers to exploit unexplored and seemingly unusable data that can, when modelled with the proper tools, serve to inform management and conservation policies.},

Mortality associated with collision could lead to negative impacts on seabird populations, and needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Within environmental impact assessments, the Collision Vulnerability Index is frequently used to assess collision risk, and is based on several vulnerability factors among which flight height is the most critical. We therefore conducted a comprehensive literature review possible for the 82 species, including breeding and migrating birds, focusing on flight height and three others collision risk factors. We calculated an Uncertainty Level associated with flight height to take into account its reliability when calculating the Collision Vulnerability index. For approx. 20 species, the available information is satisfactory to assess flight heights. However, we identified 60 species for which further data collection is necessary to reduce uncertainty about vulnerability to wind turbine collisions, and identified existing {GPS} data which may facilitate further work. Within X-{ROTOR}, collision risk factors will be coupled with habitat use and conservation status into the Collision Vulnerability Index. This index will be applied to seabird distribution data to aid identification of suitable areas for the development of the X-{ROTOR} turbines.},

	abstract = {Offshore wind farms may affect bird populations through collision mortality and displacement. Given the pressures to develop offshore wind farms, there is an urgent need to assess population-level impacts on protected marine birds. Here we refine an approach to assess aspects of their ecology that influence population vulnerability to wind farm impacts, also taking into account the conservation importance of each species. Flight height appears to be a key factor influencing collision mortality risk but improved data on flight heights of marine birds are needed. Collision index calculations identify populations of gulls, white-tailed eagles, northern gannets and skuas as of particularly high concern in Scottish waters. Displacement index calculations identify populations of divers and common scoters as most vulnerable to population-level impacts of displacement, but these are likely to be less evident than impacts of collision mortality. The collision and displacement indices developed here for Scottish marine bird populations could be applied to populations elsewhere, and this approach will help in identifying likely impacts of future offshore wind farms on marine birds and prioritising monitoring programmes, at least until data on macro-avoidance rates become available.},

Data were compiled from offshore boat and aerial observer surveys spanning the period 1979–2012. The data were analysed using distance analysis and Density Surface Modelling to produce predicted bird densities across a grid covering English territorial waters at a resolution of 3 km×3 km. Coefficients of Variation were estimated for each grid cell density, as an indication of confidence in predictions. Offshore wind farm sensitivity scores were compiled for seabird species using English territorial waters. The comparative risks to each species of collision with turbines and displacement from operational turbines were reviewed and scored separately, and the scores were multiplied by the bird density estimates to produce relative sensitivity maps. The sensitivity maps reflected well the amassed distributions of the most sensitive species. {SeaMaST} is an important new tool for assessing potential impacts on seabird populations from offshore development at a time when multiple large areas of development are proposed which overlap with many seabird species’ ranges. It will inform marine spatial planning as well as identifying priority areas of sea usage by marine birds. Example {SeaMaST} outputs are presented.},

Les objectifs de ces campagne sont :1. Évaluer la biomasse des petits pélagiques (anchois, sardines) par méthode directe. Pour cela, la campagne doit alterner entre prospection acoustique et chalutages d'identification. Un signal acoustique est envoyé depuis un sondeur fixé sous le navire et chaque fois qu'il rencontre le fond ou des bancs de poissons, il est réfléchi et retransmis aux sondeurs. Ainsi, on peut observer en continu la forme et l'intensité de ces échos qui matérialisent les bancs de poissons. Des chalutages d'identification des espèces sont effectués afin de définir la proportion des espèces présentes dans les échos détectés.2. Collecter le plus grand nombre de paramètres biologiques possible sur les espèces cibles de petits pélagiques (anchois, sardines, sprats) pour mieux comprendre la dynamique de population de ces espèces. Pour cela, des mesures morphométriques, ainsi que la détermination du sexe et du stade de maturité des poissons sont réalisées. Enfin, des otolithes sont prélevés afin de pouvoir déterminer l'âge des poissons, les taux de gras mesurés pour avoir un indicateur de leur état de santé. Ces paramètres biologiques sont très importants pour compléter l'évaluation de biomasse et avoir une meilleure compréhension des processus sous-jacents à la variabilité de ces populations. Cela permet par exemple de déterminer la structure en âge ou en taille des populations, d'avoir une idée de leurs réserves énergétiques, etc.3. Mieux comprendre l'écosystème pélagique dans son ensemble, du plancton aux prédateurs supérieurs. La campagne {PELMED} vise principalement l'évaluation des stocks de petits pélagiques, tout en recueillant un large éventail de données sur les divers aspects de l'écosystème pélagique. Cela englobe les paramètres physiques tels que la température et la salinité, les prédateurs supérieurs tels que les mammifères marins et les oiseaux, ainsi que les différents niveaux trophiques inférieurs, notamment le phyto- et le zooplancton, ainsi que les poissons petits pélagiques. L'objectif ultime est de développer une approche écosystémique des pêches, de promouvoir une gestion intégrée des écosystèmes et d'enrichir nos connaissances sur le fonctionnement de l'écosystème pélagique du Golfe du Lion. Ainsi, après chaque chalutage, une station hydrologique est réalisée avec des mesures de température, conductivité, densité, oxygène, {pH}, radiance et fluorescence le long de la colonne d'eau via une bathysonde, des prélèvements d'eau et de phytoplancton avec une bouteille Niskin et des prélèvements de zooplancton à l'aide de traits verticaux au filet {WP}2 et obliques au filet bongo. Afin de mieux connaître le compartiment planctonique, d'autres prélèvements sont envisagés comme des traits verticaux de {MultiNet}, qui permettraient de mieux comprendre la distribution verticale du zooplancton. Enfin, tout au long de la campagne nous réalisons l'observation et le comptage des oiseaux et mammifères marins. En plus de la compréhension de l'écosystème, ceci permet de fournir un certain nombre d'indicateurs nécessaires au suivi du milieu marin.},

	abstract = {1 Marine wind farms have attracted substantial public interest. The construction of wind facilities offshore may become Europe's most extensive technical development in marine habitats. Due to political pressure to complete construction soon, assessments of possible wind farm locations, for example in the German sectors of the North Sea and Baltic Sea, have to be based on existing knowledge. 2 In this study, we developed a wind farm sensitivity index ({WSI}) for seabirds. We applied this index to the Exclusive Economic Zone and the national waters of Germany in the North Sea. We chose nine factors, derived from species’ attributes, to be included in the {WSI}: flight manoeuvrability; flight altitude; percentage of time flying; nocturnal flight activity; sensitivity towards disturbance by ship and helicopter traffic; flexibility in habitat use; biogeographical population size; adult survival rate; and European threat and conservation status. Each factor was scored on a 5-point scale from 1 (low vulnerability of seabirds) to 5 (high vulnerability of seabirds). Five of these factors could be dealt with by real data but four could only be assessed by subjective considerations based on at-sea experience; in the latter cases, suggestions of the first author were independently modulated by experts. 3 Species differed greatly in their sensitivity index ({SSI}). Black-throated diver Gavia arctica and red-throated diver Gavia stellata ranked highest (= most sensitive), followed by velvet scoter Melanitta fusca, sandwich tern Sterna sandvicensis and great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo. The lowest values were recorded for black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, black-headed gull Larus ridibundus and northern fulmar Fulmarus glacialis. 4 A {WSI} score for areas of the North Sea and Baltic Sea was calculated from the species-specific sensitivity index values. Coastal waters in the south-eastern North Sea had values indicating greater vulnerability than waters further offshore throughout the whole year. 5 Derived from the frequency distribution of the {WSI}, we suggest a ‘level of concern’ and a ‘level of major concern’ that are visualized spatially and could act as a basis for the selection of marine wind farm locations. 6 Synthesis and applications. The wind farm sensitivity index might be useful in strategic environmental impact assessments ({EIA}). Results of small-scale {EIA} from wind installations should be considered within a more global perspective, provided, for example, by large mapping projects and detailed behavioural studies. This is difficult in normal {EIA}, particularly in highly dynamic coastal/marine habitats, and the results of this study fill an important gap by providing information on the potential sensitivity of seabirds and the importance of locations of wind installations.},

The creation of marine protected areas plays an important role in the conservation of marine environment and its biodiversity. The distributions of top predators, as seabirds, have been commonly used for the management and creation of these figures of protection. The main objective of this study is to investigate seabirds biodiversity distribution in the Mediterranean Sea through the use of Bayesian spatial Beta regression models. We used an extensive historical database of at-sea locations of 19 different seabird species as well as geophysical, climatology variables and cumulative anthropogenic threats to model species biodiversity. We found negative associations between seabirds biodiversity and distance to the coast as well as concavity of the seabed, and positive with chlorophyll and slope. Further, a positive association was found between seabirds biodiversity and coastal impact. In this study we define as hot spot of seabird biodiversity those areas with a posterior predictive mean over 0.50. We found potential hot spots in the Mediterranean Sea which do not overlap with the existing {MPASs} and marine {IBAs}. Specifically, our hot spots areas do not overlap with the 52.04\% and 16.87\% of the current {MPAs} and marine {IBAs}, respectively. Overall, our study highlights the need for the extension of spatial prioritization of conservation areas to seabirds biodiversity, addressing the challenges of establishing transboundary governance.},

	abstract = {Seabird distributions are determined by physical and biological factors operating at variable scales and levels of ecological organization. Accordingly, changes in the composition of the marine avifauna often correspond to large-scale (macro-mega) shifts in water mass properties. Yet, few studies have addressed biogeographical patterns across multiple current systems, spanning from highly-productive to oligotrophic waters. In this study, we characterize the at-sea assemblages of nesting seabirds across the Eastern South Pacific Ocean ({ESPO}), a vast region spanning from the Humboldt Current to the South Pacific Gyre. Employing multivariate techniques, we first identify four distinct species assemblages and then relate their distributions to the underlying environmental conditions. Our results show that Julian day, depth, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and chlorophyll-α concentration are the most important factors explaining the distribution patterns of these assemblages. Moreover, environmental conditions also explain overall seabird abundance and species richness, two community-level characteristics indicative of ocean productivity. Seabird abundance was best explained by four variables, associated with onshore-offshore gradients (distance to the coast, ocean depth), and the influence of coastal upwelling (mean mixed layer depth, sea surface salinity). Richness was best explained by seasonality (Julian day) and by the presence of water mass boundaries (sea surface temperature coefficient of variation). Our findings underscore the importance of environmental factors structuring the distribution and biogeography of seabirds across gradients of ocean productivity and water mass properties. Understanding the environmental drivers of seabird abundance and richness in the {ESPO} will inform the prioritization and design of effective marine conservation measures in this poorly studied region.},

This paper examines bias associated with pelagic aerial strip-transects, an easily designed and low cost survey method, to validate its use for monitoring and mapping seabird populations at sea at a very large scale. We used data collected on the entire seabird community between October 2001 and March 2002 in the Bay of Biscay (100000 km2 on the French Atlantic coast, Northeast Atlantic) to determine whether aerial strip-transect seabird survey were subject to temporal (i.e. variations of detection probability during the survey) or distance (i.e. variations of detection probability across the strip) bias. To detect these biases, two seabird taxa were contrasted, the highly conspicuous northern gannet versus three cryptic species of auks pooled as one taxonomic group. We reported that the only temporal bias was attributable to sun glare. By contrast, distance bias did not occur in a strip of 150 m for both species, and the effect of distance up to 230 m was very weak. We conclude that visibility bias have a limited effect on pelagic aerial surveys for most seabird species. Particular attention should be paid to the constant record of sun glare, while altitude and speed can be fixed in a relatively wide range (140–180 m, 150–200 km/h) without affecting detection probability. Since distance bias did not occur across a 150 m strip, there is no need to add complexity to survey protocol by using line-transect method. This method takes distance effects into account but requires distance estimates between the bird and the transect line for every sightings. These estimates are usually easily collected in the case of marine mammals but become problematic in the case of flying animals such seabirds, sometimes encountered in very high density and aggregated into groups of several hundred individuals.},

Two models for the line transect method ("fixed-distance" and "variable-distance") are discussed. The fixed-distance model is shown to be essentially the same as that for the line-intercept method. The assumption of random locations of individuals is not needed for estimation. "Group-flushes" pose a problem only if there is a correlation between flushing-distance and group size. A possible bias arising from assumption of a negative exponential distribution model is evaluated by computer simulation. An estimation method derived by D. W. Hayne is shown to be "robust," and a variance estimate suitable for survey design is given. The present line transect methods may not be suitable for inanimate objects, so a non-parametric approach is given. Some of the problems of applying transect theory to marine mammals are described.},

	abstract = {Ecological niche models are widely used in terrestrial studies to address critical ecological and evolutionary questions related to past and future climate change, local adaptation and speciation, the discovery of rare endemics, and biological invasions. However the application of niche models to similar questions in marine ecosystems has lagged behind, in part due to the lack of a centralized high-resolution spatial data set representing both benthic and pelagic marine environments. Here we describe the creation of {MARSPEC}, a high-resolution {GIS} database of ocean climate layers intended for marine ecological niche modeling and other applications in marine spatial ecology. {MARSPEC} combines information related to topographic complexity of the seafloor with bioclimatic measures of sea surface temperature and salinity for the world ocean. We derived seven geophysical variables from a high-resolution raster grid representing depth of the seafloor (bathymetry) to characterize six facets of topographic complexity (east–west and north–south components of aspect, slope, concavity of the seafloor, and plan and profile curvature) and distance from shore. We further derived 10 bioclimatic variables describing the annual mean, range, variance, and extreme values for temperature and salinity from long-term monthly climatological means obtained from remotely sensed and in situ oceanographic observations. All variables were clipped to a common land mask, interpolated to a nominal 1-km (30 arc-second) grid, and converted to an {ESRI} raster grid file format compatible with popular {GIS} programs. {MARSPEC} is a 10-fold improvement in spatial resolution over the next-best data set (Bio-{ORACLE}) and is the only high-resolution global marine data set to combine variables from the benthic and pelagic environments into a single database. Additionally, we provide the monthly climatological layers used to derive the bioclimatic variables, allowing users to calculate equivalent {MARSPEC} variables from anomaly data for past and future climate scenarios. A detailed description of {GIS} processing steps required to calculate the {MARSPEC} variables can be found in the metadata.},

	abstract = {In order to be able to forecast the weather and estimate future climate changes in the ocean, it is crucial to understand the past and the mechanisms responsible for the ocean variability. This is particularly true in a complex area such as the Mediterranean Sea with diverse dynamics like deep convection and overturning circulation. To this end, effective tools are ocean reanalyses or reconstructions of the past ocean state. Here we present a new physical reanalysis of the Mediterranean Sea at high resolution, developed in the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service ({CMEMS}) framework. The hydrodynamic model is based on the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean ({NEMO}) combined with a variational data assimilation scheme ({OceanVar}). The model has a horizontal resolution of 1/24° and 141 unevenly distributed vertical z* levels. It provides daily and monthly temperature, salinity, current, sea level and mixed layer depth as well as hourly fields for surface velocities and sea level. {ECMWF} {ERA}-5 atmospheric fields force the model and daily boundary conditions in the Atlantic are taken from a global reanalysis. The reanalysis covers the 33 years from 1987 to 2019. Initialized from {SeaDataNet} climatology in January 1985, it reaches a nominal state after a two-years spin-up. In-situ data from {CTD}, {ARGO} floats and {XBT} are assimilated into the model in combination with satellite altimetry observations. This reanalysis has been validated and assessed through comparison to in-situ and satellite observations as well as literature climatologies. The results show an overall improvement of the comparison with observations and a better representation of the main dynamics of the region compared to a previous, lower resolution (1/16°), reanalysis. Temperature and salinity {RMSD} are decreased by respectively 14\% and 18\%. The salinity biases at depth of the previous version are corrected. Climate signals show continuous increase of the temperature and salinity, confirming estimates from observations and other reanalysis. The new reanalysis will allow the study of physical processes at multi-scales, from the large scale to the transient small mesoscale structures and the selection of climate indicators for the basin.},

We present a reanalysis of the Mediterranean Sea biogeochemistry at 1/24° resolution developed in the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service ({CMEMS}) framework. The reanalysis is based on the Biogeochemical Flux Model ({BFM}) coupled with a variational data assimilation scheme (3DVarBio) and forced by the {NEMO}-{OceanVar} physical reanalysis and {ECMWF} {ERA}-5 atmospheric fields. Covering the period 1999-2019 with daily means of published and validated 12 biogeochemical state variables, the reanalysis assimilates surface chlorophyll and integrates {EMODnet} data as initial conditions, World Ocean Atlas ({WOA}) data at the Atlantic boundary, {CO}2 atmospheric observations and yearly estimates for riverine nutrients inputs. Using multiple observation sources (remote, in situ and Argo), the quality of the biogeochemical reanalysis was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed with three validation levels that include the evaluation of the 12 state variables and fluxes, and several process-oriented metrics. The results show an overall good skill of the reanalysis in simulating the basin-wide values and variability of the biogeochemical variables. Uncertainty in reproducing observations at mesoscale and weekly temporal scale is satisfactory for chlorophyll, nutrients, oxygen and carbonate system variables in the epipelagic layers, while it increases for few variables (i.e., oxygen, ammonium) in the mesopelagic layers. The vertical dynamics of phytoplankton and nitrate is positively evaluated with {BGC}-Argo specific metrics. As a consequence of continuous increase of temperature and salinity documented in the Mediterranean Sea in the last 20 years, and of atmospheric {CO}2 invasion, we observe basin-wide biogeochemical signals reporting surface deoxygenation, increase of alkalinity and {DIC} concentration, and decrease of {pH} at surface. The new, high-resolution reanalysis, open and freely available from the Copernicus Marine Service, allows users from different communities to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of 12 biogeochemical variables and fluxes at different scales (from mesoscale to basin-wide and from daily to multi-year) and the interaction between physical and biogeochemical processes shaping the Mediterranean marine ecosystem functioning.},

The seasonal distribution and abundance of several cetacean species were studied with a large aerial survey over the North-Western Mediterranean Sea, including the international Pelagos sanctuary, the largest Marine Protected Area ({MPA}) designed for marine mammals in the Mediterranean. A total of 8 distinct species of cetaceans were identified, and their occurrence within the sanctuary was investigated. Abundance estimates were obtained for three groups of species: the small delphinids (striped dolphins mainly), the bottlenose dolphin and the fin whale. There was a seasonal variation in striped dolphin abundance between winter (57,300 individuals, 95\% {CI}: 34,500–102,000) and summer (130,000, 95\% {CI}: 76,800–222,100). In contrast, bottlenose dolphin winter abundance was thrice that of summer. It was also the only species to exhibit any preference for the Pelagos sanctuary. Fin whale abundance had the reverse pattern with winter abundance (1000 individuals, 95\% {CI}: 500–2500) and summer (2500 individuals, 95\% {CI}: 1500–4300), without any preference for the sanctuary. Risso's dolphins, pilot whales and sperm whales did not exhibit strong seasonal pattern in their abundance.

We present a synthesis of the current state of knowledge about collision risk and avoidance behaviour in seabirds. Evidence suggests species-specific responses to turbines and that in order to avoid collision, most birds adjust their flight paths at some distance from the turbines, rather than making last-second adjustments. We highlight the key gaps in knowledge and make recommendations for future data collection.},

	abstract = {The need for alternative energy systems like offshore wind power to move towards the Green Deal objectives is undeniable. However, it is also increasingly clear that biodiversity loss and climate change are interconnected issues that must be tackled in unison. In this paper we highlight that offshore wind farms ({OWF}) in the Mediterranean Sea ({MS}) pose serious environmental risks to the seabed and the biodiversity of many areas due to the particular ecological and socioeconomic characteristics and vulnerability of this semi-enclosed sea. The {MS} hosts a high diversity of species and habitats, many of which are threatened. Furthermore, valuable species, habitats, and seascapes for citizens' health and well-being coexist with compounding effects of other economic activities (cruises, maritime transport, tourism activities, fisheries and aquaculture) in a busy space on a narrower continental shelf than in other European seas. We argue that simply importing the {OWF} models from the northern European seas, which are mostly based on large scale projects, to other seas like the Mediterranean is not straightforward. The risks of implementing these wind farms in the {MS} have not yet been well evaluated and, considering the Precautionary Principle incorporated into the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, they should not be ignored. We propose that {OWF} development in the {MS} should be excluded from high biodiversity areas containing sensitive and threatened species and habitats, particularly those situated inside or in the vicinity of Marine Protected Areas or areas with valuable seascapes. In the absence of a clearer and comprehensive {EU} planning of wind farms in the {MS}, the trade-off between the benefits (climate goals) and risks (environmental and socioeconomic impacts) of {OWF} could be unbalanced in favor of the risks.},

Seabird species exhibit different behavioural reactions to {OWFs}, ranging from avoidance resulting in habitat loss, to attraction causing an increased risk of colliding with the turbines. We investigated how {OWFs} affected the densities and distributions of guillemots and kittiwakes breeding in the southern North Sea and if the effects varied among seasons using a ‘before–after control impact’ ({BACI}) analysis approach based on a large-scale and long-term dataset covering 14 years before and 3 years after the construction of {OWFs}. Guillemot relative density in the {OWF} decreased by 63\% in spring, and by 44\% in the breeding season. Kittiwake relative density in the {OWF} decreased by 45\% in the breeding season, and not significantly by 10\% in spring. We furthermore estimated the response radii to the {OWF} for both species and seasons, finding that guillemots showed a response radius of {\textasciitilde}9 km in spring and kittiwakes a radius of {\textasciitilde}20 km in the breeding season. The results underline the value of large-scale and long-term assessments considering seasonal variation throughout the yearly cycle. The here provided information on the seasonally different reactions of seabirds to {OWFs} adds substantially to our current knowledge and provides the necessary basis for reliable estimations of {OWF} effects on guillemots and kittiwakes.

Marine birds in particular have life history traits that amplify population impacts from displacement and collision with offshore wind infrastructure. Here, we present a broadly applicable framework to assess and mitigate the impacts of {OWED} on marine birds. We outline existing techniques to quantify impact via monitoring and modeling (e.g., collision risk models, population viability analysis), and present a robust mitigation framework to avoid, minimize, or compensate for {OWED} impacts. Our framework addresses impacts within the context of multiple stressors across multiple wind energy developments. We also present technological and methodological approaches that can improve impact estimation and mitigation. We highlight compensatory mitigation as a tool that can be incorporated into regulatory frameworks to mitigate impacts that cannot be avoided or minimized via siting decisions or alterations to {OWED} infrastructure or operation. Our framework is intended as a globally-relevant approach for assessing and mitigating {OWED} impacts on marine birds that may be adapted to existing regulatory frameworks in regions with existing or planned {OWED}.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy sectors have been rapidly growing over the last three decades due to the environmental concerns regarding fossil fuels and increasing demand of energy by human. Among those, offshore wind farms are one of the most attractive and promising technologies for clean energy production due to the strong and steady offshore winds, less turbine fatigue, less visual and space limitations compared to onshore wind farms. Rapid development of offshore wind farms, which is expected to reach 70\% by 2030, can effect on marine ecosystems and organisms. Hitherto, different studies have comprehensively discussed the potential impacts of offshore wind farms on marine habitats; however, they are just potential and rarely validated through observations. This review focuses on the proved environmental impacts of offshore wind farms gained from post-construction environmental monitoring programs. Particularly, this study provides significant insights on: 1) the area and time span over which biological effects may occur, 2) responses to disturbance by different target organisms; 3) quantification of short/long-term effects; 4) recovery from impacts in the long term. The monitoring studies showed little or only local impacts of offshore wind farms on the marine environment, either during their construction or the operational phases. However, further research is needed to answer whether synergies of little and local impacts may determine consequences at the population level. As the number and size of offshore wind farms increase it is necessary to consider consequences at the population level as well as cumulative impacts of these activities on marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Aim Species often remain undetected at sites where they are present. However, the impact of imperfect detection on species distribution models ({SDMs}) is not fully appreciated. In this paper we evaluate the influence of imperfect detection on the calibration and discrimination capacity of {SDMs}. We compare the performance of three types of {SDMs}: (1) a technique based on presence–absence data, (2) a technique based on presence–background data, and (3) a technique based on detection/non-detection data that accounts for imperfect detection. Innovation We use simulations to evaluate the impacts of imperfect detection in {SDMs}. This allows us to assess model performance with respect to the true objective of the models: the estimation of species distributions. We study a range of scenarios of occupancy and detection based on ecologically plausible environmental relationships and identify the circumstances in which imperfect detection affects model calibration and discrimination. We show that imperfect detection can substantially reduce the inferential and predictive accuracy of presence–absence and presence–background methods that do not account for detectability. While calibration is always affected, the influence on discrimination depends on the relationship of detectability and environmental variables. Main conclusions The performance of a model should be assessed with respect to its objectives. Comparative studies that intend to assess the performance of an {SDM} by evaluating its ability to predict detections rather than presences fail to reveal the benefits of accounting for detectability. Disregarding imperfect detection can have severe consequences for {SDM} performance, and hence for the estimation of species distributions. To date, this issue has been largely ignored in the {SDM} literature. Simultaneously modelling occupancy and detection does not necessarily require a greater sampling effort, but rather that data are collected so that they are informative about detectability. We recommend that consideration of imperfect detection become standard practice for species distribution modelling.},

	abstract = {In a recent paper, Welsh, Lindenmayer and Donnelly ({WLD}) question the usefulness of models that estimate species occupancy while accounting for detectability. {WLD} claim that these models are difficult to fit and argue that disregarding detectability can be better than trying to adjust for it. We think that this conclusion and subsequent recommendations are not well founded and may negatively impact the quality of statistical inference in ecology and related management decisions. Here we respond to {WLD}'s claims, evaluating in detail their arguments, using simulations and/or theory to support our points. In particular, {WLD} argue that both disregarding and accounting for imperfect detection lead to the same estimator performance regardless of sample size when detectability is a function of abundance. We show that this, the key result of their paper, only holds for cases of extreme heterogeneity like the single scenario they considered. Our results illustrate the dangers of disregarding imperfect detection. When ignored, occupancy and detection are confounded: the same naïve occupancy estimates can be obtained for very different true levels of occupancy so the size of the bias is unknowable. Hierarchical occupancy models separate occupancy and detection, and imprecise estimates simply indicate that more data are required for robust inference about the system in question. As for any statistical method, when underlying assumptions of simple hierarchical models are violated, their reliability is reduced. Resorting in those instances where hierarchical occupancy models do no perform well to the naïve occupancy estimator does not provide a satisfactory solution. The aim should instead be to achieve better estimation, by minimizing the effect of these issues during design, data collection and analysis, ensuring that the right amount of data is collected and model assumptions are met, considering model extensions where appropriate.},

	abstract = {Summary. Spatial replication is a common theme in count surveys of animals. Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association80, 423–426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},

	abstract = {Generalized estimators of avian abundance from count survey data
.� I consider modeling avian abundance
from spatially referenced bird count data collected according to common protocols such as capture�
recapture, multiple observer, removal sampling and simple point counts. Small sample sizes and large
numbers of parameters have motivated many analyses that disregard the spatial indexing of the data, and
thus do not provide an adequate treatment of spatial structure. I describe a general framework for modeling
spatially replicated data that regards local abundance as a random process, motivated by the view that the
set of spatially referenced local populations (at the sample locations) constitute a metapopulation. Under
this view, attention can be focused on developing a model for the variation in local abundance independent
of the sampling protocol being considered. The metapopulation model structure, when combined with the
data generating model, define a simple hierarchical model that can be analyzed using conventional
methods. The proposed modeling framework is completely general in the sense that broad classes of
metapopulation models may be considered, site level covariates on detection and abundance may be
considered, and estimates of abundance and related quantities may be obtained for sample locations,
groups of locations, unsampled locations. Two brief examples are given, the first involving simple point
counts, and the second based on temporary removal counts. Extension of these models to open systems
is briefly discussed.},

Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were contin- ued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normal- ity after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random- effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

	abstract = {We describe {NIMBLE}, a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. {NIMBLE} is designed to meet three challenges: flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency. For model specification, {NIMBLE} extends the {BUGS} language and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among variables. For algorithm programming, {NIMBLE} provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, {NIMBLE} compiles models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and provides the user with an interface to compiled objects. The {NIMBLE} language represents a compilable domain-specific language ({DSL}) embedded within R. This paper provides an overview of the design and rationale for {NIMBLE} along with illustrative examples including importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) and Monte Carlo expectation maximization ({MCEM}).},

Input data were based on several recurrent scientific surveys, two alternative datasets for fishing data, stock assessment outputs, stomach content analyses and published information. Results showed that the functional groups were organised into five trophic levels with the highest one represented by dolphins, anglerfish, Atlantic bluefin tuna, European hake and European conger. European pilchard and European anchovy dominated in terms of fish biomass and catch. Other fish with high biomass such as Atlantic mackerel and blue whiting were highly important in the food web. Seabirds, dolphins and cuttlefish–squids represented keystone species. Important coupled pelagic–demersal–benthic interactions were described. The 7 different fisheries analysed were operating at mean trophic levels situated between 2.6 for small artisanal boats, and 4.1 for purse seines ({\textgreater}24m) targeting large pelagic fish, indicating an intensively exploited ecosystem. Large trawlers (24–40m) had the highest impact on most of the groups considered; while purse seines (12–24m) targeting small pelagic fish had the lowest impact.

We review post-construction studies of seabirds at 20 {OWFs} in European waters to extract and classify evidence for displacement or attraction of 33 different seabird species. Divers and northern gannets showed consistent and strong avoidance behaviour/displacement, and this may also be the case for great crested grebe and northern fulmar. Long-tailed duck, common scoter, Manx shearwater, razorbill, common guillemot, little gull and sandwich tern showed less consistent displacement from {OWFs}. Several gull species and red-breasted merganser showed weak attraction, while great cormorant and European shag showed strong attraction to {OWFs}. Other species show little response. Displacement seems mainly to be due to bird responses to {OWF} structures and appears stronger when turbines are rotating, but could in part be due to boat traffic to and from {OWFs}. Attraction of cormorants relates at least in part to their use of structures for roosting and for drying plumage, but increases in food availability at {OWFs} appears to be an important influence for several species.},

The samples with the highest and lowest microplastic count originate both from the Bay of Marseille. For the Bay of Marseille, it is estimated that the total microplastic load consist of 519 · 103 –101 · 106 items weighing 0.07–118 kg. Estimations for daily microplastic transport by the Northern Current and the Rhône River, two important hydrologic features of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, range from 0.18 to 86.46 t and from 0.20 to 21.32 kg, respectively. Particles {\textless} 1 mm2 clearly dominated sampling stations in the Northern Current, the Rhône River and its plume (52, 53 and 61\%, respectively), suggesting a long exposure time in the environment. Items between 1 mm2 and 5 mm2 in size were the most abundant microplastics in Marseille Bay (55\%), which suggests coastal pollution sources or the removal of smaller particles from surface waters e.g. by ballasting owing to the presence of epibionts.},

It is the first time this event is studied with simultaneous hydrological and current data. This dilution zone extends as far as 5.27°E in longitude (45km from the Rhone river mouth). At longitude 5.13°E (37km from the Rhone river mouth), the dilution zone is 40m deep and spreads over 0.075° latitude (8km). It is due to an eastward current present there throughout the {ADCP}-detected range (12–120m). The analysis of moored {ADCP} time series reveals that such eastward currents occur there about 18\% of the time and that diluted waters from the Rhone reach the Station d’Observation Fixe ({SOFI}) site between 3.9\% and 8.4\% of the time. This December 2003 event is the consequence of the combined effects of a storm with east winds and the presence of freshwater along the coast.},

The Rhone River diluted water intrusions into the Bay of Marseille were investigated, examining their physical generation processes and associated biogeochemical impact by using in situ observations, remote sensing data, and a three-dimensional physical/biogeochemical coupled model. During our study period from 2007 to 2011, Rhone River intrusions occurred on average 7.6 times per year and affected more frequently the northern part of the bay. A classification of intrusion events in three categories is proposed (short lived, big, and small) as a function of their duration and spatial extent. The intrusions appeared to be driven by: (i) wind forcing, (ii) the presence of a mesoscale eddy, (iii) the Rhone River discharge volume, and (iv) the variation in thermocline depth. Typically, a combination of these favorable factors was necessary to induce an intrusion. An intrusion strongly impacts the biogeochemical functioning of the Bay of Marseille by bringing large quantities of nutrients into the bay. Mass balances were computed allowing us to quantify this impact on the Bay of Marseille. The results show that the ecological impact depends very much on the type of intrusion, with big intrusions having the highest impact.},

The diagrams presented 10 years ago [Millot, C., 1987a. Circulation in the Western Mediterranean. Oceanol. Acta, 10, 2, 143–149.] have been confirmed and complemented, mainly in the south where all water masses appear to flow anticlockwise along the continental slope, as they do everywhere else in the sea. Definitive results have also been obtained about the mesoscale phenomena in the Algerian Basin which induce a dramatic variability of the circulation of all water masses, as far as around the Balearic Islands and through the Channel of Sardinia. Extremely interesting observations have been collected between Sicily, Tunisia and Sardinia about the hydrological and dynamical characteristics of the waters entering the Tyrrhenian Sea. Finally, the dense water formation processes have been specified, mainly since some uncommon situations have been encountered. As a whole, the relatively large importance of the seasonal (resp. mesoscale) variability in the north (resp. south) has been documented. Together, the observations in nature, the laboratory experiments and the numerical models have thus provided a more thorough understanding of the sea dynamics. Nevertheless, uncertainties remain about the amount of the waters formed in the sea mainly at intermediate depths, for these waters are often not easily distinguished from the surrounding ones. This is of major importance for, a priori, intermediate waters can flow out of the sea more easily than deep waters. In any case, the southern Tyrrhenian Sea appears to be a key place for the functionning of the whole sea.},

	abstract = {{ADCP}, thermosalinograph, and meteorological data were collected during a short cruise ({SARHYGOL} 3; June 13–15, 2000) throughout the Gulf of Lions, {NW} Mediterranean Sea. The 3-D hydrodynamical model Symphonie reproduces well the circulation features observed in situ. The Northern Current ({NC})—geostrophic current bordering the gulf along its continental slope—is well modeled with slight differences in its position. When the modeled stratification of the gulf is shallower than the measured stratification, the modeled {NC} is further offshore than the real {NC} (and reciprocally). The model allows the determination of the life-time and generating processes of the intrusions of the {NC} on the shelf. During the cruise, two different types of intrusions of the {NC} are found: (1) an intrusion at the eastern side of the gulf, that lasted 5 days and was due to a combination of the water column stratification and wind-forcing effects at the start of the continental shelf; (2) an intrusion at the center of the gulf, that lasted less than 12h and was generated by the proximity of a positive and a negative wind stress curls. The coupled in situ data/model analysis also provides a better understanding on inertial oscillations. A strong inertial oscillation, with maximum amplitude of 60cm/s, is clearly observed at the western side of the gulf due to the absence of the {NC} there. The model also exhibits this oscillation, and provides its temporal variations. The analysis, closely coupling in situ measurements and model results, provides information that would not have been obtained using either data separately.},

	abstract = {The size structure of zooplankton communities in the Gulf of Lion, {NW} Mediterranean Sea, was studied in May 2010 and January 2011. The integrated physical and biological measurements provided a 3D view with high spatial resolution of the physical and biological variables and their correlations over the whole gulf. The effects of physical processes such as freshwater input, coastal upwelling, and water column mixing by winds on phytoplankton and zooplankton distributions were analyzed using these data. During the winter, strong northerly winds mixed the water column, and the vertical distributions of biological variables were uniform over most of the gulf while there were local hot spots with high chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations in front of the Rhône mouths and in coastal areas. During the spring, light winds and water column stratification resulted in less vertical mixing, and the Rhône River freshwater plume spread over a large part of the gulf. The nutrients delivered by the freshwater input encouraged high primary production in the surface layer. In the pycnocline, a thin layer of high particle concentration was associated with these high phytoplankton biomasses. Three habitats were distinguished based on statistical analysis performed on biological and physical variables: (1) the coastal area characterized by shallow waters, high chl a concentrations, and a steep slope of the normalized biomass size spectrum ({NBSS}); (2) the area affected by the Rhône with high stratification and flat {NBSS} slope; and (3) the continental shelf with a deep mixed layer, relatively low particle concentrations, and moderate {NBSS} slope. Defining habitat is a relevant approach to designing new zooplankton sampling strategies, validating distribution models and including the zooplankton compartment in trophodynamic studies.},

	abstract = {Among {FAO}’s Major Fishing Areas, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea had the highest percentage (62.5\%) of stocks fished at unsustainable levels, especially demersal stocks. Spatial-temporal restrictions of fishing activities are important measures used for the management of marine stocks. However, sometimes these regulations are not fully implemented due to a lack of effectiveness and compliance, which contributes to their failure. Here, we developed a food-web model approach using the Ecopath with Ecosim ({EwE}) model representing the Fisheries Restricted Area ({FRA}) of the Gulf of Lion ecosystem ({CoSEGoL} model) prior to the establishment of the fisheries restrictions (2006–2008). We characterized the structure and functioning of the ecosystem before and after its establishment. The constructed food-web model was then fitted to the available time series of data from 2008 to 2016 to verify whether this {FRA} has contributed to the recovery of target demersal species and the demersal community. The fitted model was used to explore alternative future management scenarios to explore feasible management options in order to ensure a full ecosystem recovery under climate change conditions. Our results suggest a failure in the recovery of target species in the restricted area under the current management scenario, potentially revealing a lack of protection efficiency and/or enforcement. Scenarios of management options under plausible climate futures revealed possible recovery of targeted species, especially European hake. The study highlighted the importance of considering trophic interactions between predators and prey to identify trade-offs and synergies in fisheries management outcomes and the need to consider both fishing and climate dynamics.},

	abstract = {Aim The Mediterranean sea is a winter productive oligotrophic basin where Atlantic water replaces water lost through evaporation, this influx being a major source of productivity and fertility. The long coastlines and the large number of islands cause high oceanographic heterogeneity. Moreover, during its geological history, it has dried out several times. So we describe the consequences of these particular features on species richness, distribution, and breeding ecology of marine birds. Location The Mediterranean sea (including the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov) communicates with the Atlantic Ocean only through a 14 km wide channel (Straits of Gibraltar), and since 1869, with the Red Sea through the Suez Canal. Methods The Mediterranean was subdivided into different areas, according to physical oceanographic entities and productivity, linked to numbers and distribution of both breeding and wintering marine birds (defined as species strongly dependent on marine resources, breeding only on islands and/or the coastline). Results The total marine bird biomass, and species diversity, are lower in the Mediterranean than in the near Atlantic. The eastern Mediterranean, with lowest primary productivity, contains fewer marine bird taxa than the more productive western part. Taxa which mainly occur in the western and southern parts of the Mediterranean migrate through the Straits of Gibraltar to winter in the southern Atlantic, while those inhabiting the northern and eastern parts are sedentary, as a result of differences in species composition. Northern coastal basin communities (i.e. the Tyrrhenian and the Balearic Seas), are composed of less pelagic, and earlier breeding species, that rear chicks during the productive season. These latter taxa are actually the most typical Mediterranean taxa, in terms of endemism. Main conclusions The Mediterranean marine bird community is not tropical, but rather, shows the highest affinity with the Atlantic temperate community. Its level of endemism is however high and comparable to other confined basins such as the Red Sea.},

We tested the hypothesis that French coastal {MPAs} primarily designed for coastal and benthic biota are also beneficial for the conservation of a pelagic seabird, the Vulnerable yelkouan shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan), an endemic species to the Mediterranean Sea. We used a vast spectrum of electronic devices ({GPS}, temperature-depth-recorders, satellite transmitters and geolocators) and stable isotopic analyses to study the year-round movements and the trophic status of yelkouan shearwaters from the Hyères archipelago (France). In addition we conducted large-scale ship and aircrafts observation surveys to investigate spatio-temporal density patterns of shearwaters (genus Puffinus) in the western Mediterranean Sea. This extensive investigation permitted the first comprehensive study of the at-sea ecology of yelkouan shearwaters showing strikingly coastal habits, partial migration, unsuspected diving capabilities (max dive depth of 30m), and a broad diet ranging from zooplankton to small pelagic fish. Importantly, 31\% of yelkouan shearwaters {GPS} positions associated with foraging, 38\% of diving positions, and 27\% of resting positions were within the three French {MPAs} during the breeding season. These high scores confirmed by year-round distribution derived from {GLS}, {PTTs}, at-sea and aerial observations, validated our hypothesis of the major importance of coastal {MPAs} for the conservation of yelkouan shearwater. Our case-study is therefore a major contribution to research efforts aiming at linking the spatial ecology of highly mobile marine vertebrates with effective conservation of marine biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Aim A large body of knowledge exists on individual anthropogenic threats that have an impact on marine biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea, although we know little about how these threats accumulate and interact to affect marine species and ecosystems. In this context, we aimed to identify the main areas where the interaction between marine biodiversity and threats is more pronounced and to assess their spatial overlap with current marine protected areas in the Mediterranean. Location Mediterranean Sea. Methods We first identified areas of high biodiversity of marine mammals, marine turtles, seabirds, fishes and commercial or well-documented invertebrates. We mapped potential areas of high threat where multiple threats are occurring simultaneously. Finally we quantified the areas of conservation concern for biodiversity by looking at the spatial overlap between high biodiversity and high cumulative threats, and we assessed the overlap with protected areas. Results Our results show that areas with high marine biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea are mainly located along the central and north shores, with lower values in the south-eastern regions. Areas of potential high cumulative threats are widespread in both the western and eastern basins, with fewer areas located in the south-eastern region. The interaction between areas of high biodiversity and threats for invertebrates, fishes and large animals in general (including large fishes, marine mammals, marine turtles and seabirds) is concentrated in the coastal areas of Spain, Gulf of Lions, north-eastern Ligurian Sea, Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, south-eastern Turkey and regions surrounding the Nile Delta and north-west African coasts. Areas of concern are larger for marine mammal and seabird species. Main conclusions These areas may represent good candidates for further research, management and protection activities, since there is only a maximum 2\% overlap between existing marine protected areas (which cover 5\% of the Mediterranean Sea) and our predicted areas of conservation concern for biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Domestic cats (Felis catus) have been introduced on many islands in the world and are responsible for much damage to native insular faunas. The worldwide success and spread of this opportunistic predator is generally associated with its trophic adaptability. We examined the diet of a long-established feral cat population on a small Mediterranean island through the analysis of 1,219 scats collected during a 4-year period. Our results confirm that feral cats are generalist predators, able to feed on a wide range of prey. However, only a few prey species formed the major part of its diet. Two introduced mammals and a Mediterranean endemic seabird provided 93\% of the yearly biomass consumed by cats (ship rats, 70\%; wild rabbits, 7\%; and yelkouan shearwaters, 6\%). Ship rats remained by far the staple prey for cats throughout the year, but the diet of feral cats was more diversified in spring and early summer, frequently including insects, reptiles, and migrant birds. Endemic yelkouan shearwaters were preyed upon most frequently in autumn and winter, that is, during the shearwaters' prelaying period. Because rats provide the majority of the food of cats, they could help to maintain or inflate this alien predator population with deleterious consequences to the endemic shearwater. A cat eradication campaign would help protect the population of shearwaters on this island.},

Within this framework, this research on Cory’s shearwater Calonectris diomedea integrates vessel-based survey and tracking data to provide 2 distinct, yet complementary, perspectives of the habitats of this species in the western Mediterranean during incubation in June and chick rearing in August of 2007. We used a hierarchical modelling approach to (1) delineate the foraging habitat of the species using vessel-based surveys and (2) identify its feeding habitat based on tracking data within the Information-Theoretic framework. Our habitat modelling analyses suggest that shearwaters respond to complex bio-physical coupling, illustrated by their association with frontal features and elevated ocean productivity. Our models yielded moderate predictions of Cory’s shearwater habitats within 2 distinct spatial scales. At the mesoscale, the foraging range of the species comprised the continental and insular shelf-slope waters of the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands, between the Gulf of Lions to the north and Cape Palos to the south. At the coarse scale, the tracking data highlighted important feeding areas within this larger foraging range: 3 continental shelf-slope ‘hotspots’—(1) Gulf of Lions, (2) Cape Creus–Barcelona–Ebro Delta and (3) Cape La Nao–Cape Palos; from north to south—as well as the insular shelf-slope areas around the Balearic Islands. These results match previous observations of the foraging range and feeding patterns of the species, and are consistent with the interpretation of the regional oceanography. This study highlights how the integration of tracking and vessel-based survey data can provide a wider understanding of the predictability of aggregation (i.e. hotspots) and the key oceanographic habitats of far-ranging seabirds at multiple spatial scales. Thus, complementary data integration is a step forward in conservation studies of far-ranging marine top predators.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea is a marine biodiversity hot spot. Here we combined an extensive literature analysis with expert opinions to update publicly available estimates of major taxa in this marine ecosystem and to revise and update several species lists. We also assessed overall spatial and temporal patterns of species diversity and identified major changes and threats. Our results listed approximately 17,000 marine species occurring in the Mediterranean Sea. However, our estimates of marine diversity are still incomplete as yet—undescribed species will be added in the future. Diversity for microbes is substantially underestimated, and the deep-sea areas and portions of the southern and eastern region are still poorly known. In addition, the invasion of alien species is a crucial factor that will continue to change the biodiversity of the Mediterranean, mainly in its eastern basin that can spread rapidly northwards and westwards due to the warming of the Mediterranean Sea. Spatial patterns showed a general decrease in biodiversity from northwestern to southeastern regions following a gradient of production, with some exceptions and caution due to gaps in our knowledge of the biota along the southern and eastern rims. Biodiversity was also generally higher in coastal areas and continental shelves, and decreases with depth. Temporal trends indicated that overexploitation and habitat loss have been the main human drivers of historical changes in biodiversity. At present, habitat loss and degradation, followed by fishing impacts, pollution, climate change, eutrophication, and the establishment of alien species are the most important threats and affect the greatest number of taxonomic groups. All these impacts are expected to grow in importance in the future, especially climate change and habitat degradation. The spatial identification of hot spots highlighted the ecological importance of most of the western Mediterranean shelves (and in particular, the Strait of Gibraltar and the adjacent Alboran Sea), western African coast, the Adriatic, and the Aegean Sea, which show high concentrations of endangered, threatened, or vulnerable species. The Levantine Basin, severely impacted by the invasion of species, is endangered as well. This abstract has been translated to other languages (File S1).},

Using a suite of bio-logging systems, 67 foraging trips were recorded during incubation periods between 2011 and 2014 from one of the species’ largest colonies (Sa Cella, Mallorca). Most birds followed narrow flight corridors to restricted neritic foraging grounds on the Iberian continental shelf. Productive foraging areas along the Catalan coast ({NE} Spain) were consistent across multiple years and between sexes, indicating extensive use of predictable resources. While our study emphasises the vulnerability of this species to anthropogenic activity in nearshore waters, consistent commuting corridors and foraging grounds represent tractable habitat for protection and offer hope for developing area-based management approaches. Preferred foraging areas showed strong overlap with recently declared Special Protection Areas, strengthening the evidence base for targeted management at these sites.},

This response was common to all seven ecosystems and 14 bird species examined within the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans.

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: Unintended mortality in longlines emerged in the early 1990s as one of the most important threats for pelagic seabirds worldwide. Most of the studies were focused on highly developed industrial fisheries, overlooking bycatch in small-scale artisanal fisheries. However, bycatch in small-scale fisheries might have negative effects similar to those of industrial fisheries when they overlap with hotspot areas of top predators. Moreover, different types of fishing gear coexist in the same oceanographic area, particularly in highly exploited marine ecosystems such as the western Mediterranean. We quantify for the first time the influence of trawling regime on Cory’s shearwater Calonectris diomedea bycatch in the western Mediterranean longline artisanal fishery. The availability of trawling discards has substantial influence on the foraging and breeding ecology of many seabirds, and trawling inactivity may drive shearwaters to seek alternative food resources, such as baits used in longline fishing. Based on our previous knowledge of the system, we also tested other variables affecting bycatch over 8 yr (1998 to 2005). Within this 2-fishery framework, we found that trawling regime, longline fishing time and breeding stage were key factors explaining shearwater attendance to longline vessels, but mainly trawling regime and fishing time increased the incidental capture of Cory’s shearwaters. More specifically, during the pre-breeding and chick-rearing periods, bycatch dramatically increased during sunrise sets in the absence of trawling activity. Importantly, this study indicates the need for an integrated multi-fisheries management approach for the conservation of seabirds and highlights the necessity of banning longline fishing during periods of trawling inactivity.},

Our review showed that few Mediterranean islands remain rat-free. At the regional scale, rat presence was only a limiting factor in the abundance of the smallest seabird, the storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus), while the distribution and abundance of the three shearwaters were more influenced by island characteristics. We hypothesized that the long-term persistence of these seabirds may have been facilitated by the various biogeographical contexts of Mediterranean islands, likely to provide intra-island refuges.},

Moreover, two additional factors could enhance its mercury intake: the consumption of discarded fish (which attain higher concentrations) and/or feeding in areas receiving Hg anthropogenic inputs. In order to differentiate the relevance of both sources we analysed Hg and stable isotopes of chick feathers from different breeding locations in western Mediterranean: one in its northern part (Ebro Delta) and two southern (Chafarinas Isl. and Alborán Isl.). The results from stable isotopes indicate that consumption of discards is higher at Alborán Isl., followed by the Ebro Delta and Chafarinas Isl. Thus, the higher mercury levels found in the Ebro Delta cannot be explained uniquely by the contribution of discarded fish to diet, but local pollution caused by the river Ebro waters accounts for Hg differences observed.},

Although a large number of empirical studies provide emerging evidence of impacts to wildlife, there has been little systematic assessment of risk. We performed a spatial risk analysis using predicted debris distributions and ranges for 186 seabird species to model debris exposure. We adjusted the model using published data on plastic ingestion by seabirds. Eighty of 135 (59\%) species with studies reported in the literature between 1962 and 2012 had ingested plastic, and, within those studies, on average 29\% of individuals had plastic in their gut. Standardizing the data for time and species, we estimate the ingestion rate would reach 90\% of individuals if these studies were conducted today. Using these results from the literature, we tuned our risk model and were able to capture 71\% of the variation in plastic ingestion based on a model including exposure, time, study method, and body size. We used this tuned model to predict risk across seabird species at the global scale. The highest area of expected impact occurs at the Southern Ocean boundary in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, which contrasts with previous work identifying this area as having low anthropogenic pressures and concentrations of marine debris. We predict that plastics ingestion is increasing in seabirds, that it will reach 99\% of all species by 2050, and that effective waste management can reduce this threat.},

The last five years have seen a proliferation of efforts to characterize and map cumulative impacts, providing insight into the strengths and limitations of these efforts and where opportunities lie for progress. Here we provide a review of the key assumptions that underlie most cumulative impact mapping efforts, describing the implications and rationales for the assumptions, and highlight the many challenges cumulative impact mapping efforts face. We end with a brief summary of several future research directions that will help greatly improve application of cumulative impact mapping to resource management and conservation planning efforts.},

	abstract = {With the wide scale construction of offshore wind farms ({OWFs}) throughout the entire North Sea, large areas are permanently being closed to beam trawl fisheries. Beam trawling has affected macrobenthic assemblages for centuries, especially the fragile and long-lived species. Due to the prohibition of bean trawling in many {OWFs}, opportunities are being provided to investigate the potential recovery of vulnerable species and the creation of de-facto Marine Protected Areas ({MPAs}). The soft-substrate macrobenthic community was investigated from 2008 to 2012, before and after the construction of an {OWF} in the Belgian part of the North Sea, situated on the Bligh Bank. The fishery enclosed area (±21km2) within the {OWF} (No Fishery area) was compared with a surrounding control area (±30km2) where regular fishing activities were registered through vessel monitoring system ({VMS}) data throughout the period 2010–2011. Three years after the exclusion of beam trawl fisheries, subtle changes within the macrobenthic community were observed in the No Fishery area. The benthic mysid shrimp Gastrosaccus spinifer (30±15indm−2), tube-building polychaetes Terebellidae sp. (196±151indm−2) and the echinoderm Echinocyamus pusillus (73±71indm−2), sensitive to trawling activities, showed increased abundances within the No Fishery area. With an expansion of the wind farm concession area to 238km2 in the future, the likely increase of dense Terebellidae patches (e.g., Lanice conchilega reefs) within the No Fishery area could create an ecological important large-scale refugium for higher trophic levels. This study creates a baseline for the evaluation of long-term changes due to the fishing impacts and effects related to the presence of {OWFs} and highlights the importance of executing long-term monitoring programs in combination with targeted research.},

	abstract = {Through before–after control-impact designed ship-based seabird surveys, seabird displacement occurring after the installation of an offshore wind farm at the Belgian Bligh Bank in 2010 was studied. Results demonstrate that northern gannet (Morus bassanus), common guillemot (Uria aalge) and razorbill (Alca torda) avoided the wind farm area, and decreased in abundance with 85, 71 and 64\%, respectively. Lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus) and herring gull (Larus argentatus) were attracted to the wind farm, and their numbers increased by a factor 5.3 and 9.5. Other gull species too were found to frequent the turbine-built area, most notably common gull (Larus canus), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) and great black-backed gull (Larus marinus). The ecological incentives behind the observed attraction effects are still poorly understood, but on top of the increase in roosting possibilities it is plausible that offshore wind farms offer enhanced feeding opportunities. Importantly, attraction of seabirds to offshore wind farms implies an increased collision risk.},

	abstract = {Inference and estimates of abundance are critical for quantifying population dynamics and impacts of environmental change. Yet imperfect detection and other phenomena that cause zero inflation can induce estimation error and obscure ecological patterns. Recent statistical advances provide an increasingly diverse array of analytical approaches for estimating population size to address these phenomena. We examine how detection error and zero inflation in count data inform the choice of analytical method for estimating population size of unmarked individuals that are not uniquely identified. We review two established ({GLMs} and distance sampling) and nine emerging methods that use N-mixture models (Royle–Nichols model, and basic, zero inflated, temporary emigration, beta-binomial, generalized open-population, spatially explicit, single visit and multispecies) to estimate abundance of unmarked populations, focusing on their requirements and how each method accounts for imperfect detection and zero inflation. Eight of the emerging methods can account for both imperfect detection and additional variation in population size in the forms of non-occupancy, temporary emigration, correlated detection and population dynamics. Methods differ in sampling design requirements (e.g. count vs. detection/non-detection data, single vs. multiple visits, covariate data), and their suitability for a particular study will depend on the characteristics of the study species, scale and objectives of the study, and financial and logistical considerations. Most emerging methods were developed over the past decade, so their efficacy is still under study, and additional statistical advances are likely to occur.},
